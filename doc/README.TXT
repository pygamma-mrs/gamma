The documents in the pdf directory contain valuable 
information on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with 
a focus on Magnetic Resonance Sprectroscopy (MRS), 
and some useful discussions about the GAMMA C++ code.

They were created by Scott Smith, to whom we owe a
great deal of gratitude - for his work on this library.

The documents were originally written around 1999 - 
2003, and have not been kept up to date so some of the 
technical discussions may seem dated, but they still 
serve as a very powerful introduction to the GAMMA 
library.

The complete GAMMA website, as it stood in May of 2011
has been uploaded into one of our Subversion repositories.
you can browse it or download it (with Subversion) here:
http://scion/guest_svn/gamma_docs/

The links in the HTML have not been updated to point
to this local instance; so keep that in mind if you 
choose to view the HTML documents.

The PDFs in this directory are more or less the same
as those in the gamma_docs Subversion repository.
